    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction: Nuclear Energy and Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>
        Nuclear energy is one of the most debated energy sources in the world today. Some people and organizations
        see nuclear power as a clean and reliable way to generate electricity while reducing carbon emissions and
        fighting climate change. Others focus on risks like accidents, radioactive waste, security threats, and the
        high costs of building and maintaining nuclear plants. Because the issue is so complex, it involves many
        different groups of people, governments, and organizations, all with their own interests and levels of power.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to provide a <strong>neutral overview</strong> of the nuclear energy debate by
        identifying major stakeholder groups and explaining what they value, what they might gain or lose, and how
        much influence they have in the conversation. This website does not argue for or against nuclear energy.
        Instead, it aims to show how the interests and concerns of different stakeholders shape the way nuclear power
        is discussed and decided on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This stakeholder analysis is part of Writing Project 2 for my English class and is supported by research from
        highly credible sources, including the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the International Atomic
        Energy Agency (IAEA), Pew Research Center, Bisconti Research, and Greenpeace.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Stakeholder Overview -->
    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Stakeholder Overview</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>stakeholder</strong> is any person, group, or organization that is affected by nuclear energy or has
        the ability to influence how it is used, regulated, or understood. In the case of nuclear energy, stakeholders
        include governments, regulatory agencies, power companies, international organizations, environmental groups,
        local communities, scientists, and the general public, along with future generations and the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this analysis, I divide stakeholders into two main categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct stakeholders</strong> – those who are closely involved in nuclear energy operations, policy, safety, or economics.</li>
        <li><strong>Indirect stakeholders</strong> – those who are not directly involved in the nuclear industry but are still affected by nuclear policy, public opinion, or long-term environmental consequences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Looking at both direct and indirect stakeholders shows how wide-reaching nuclear energy decisions can be.
        Below is a simple “stakeholder map” that lets you jump to each group.

        <h3>National Governments and Nuclear Regulators</h3>
        <div class="stakeholder-details">
          <p>
            National governments and nuclear regulatory agencies are some of the most powerful stakeholders in the nuclear
            energy debate. In the United States, agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department
            of Energy (DOE) help oversee nuclear power plants, safety rules, research, and waste management. A GAO report
            on nuclear energy explains that both DOE and NRC are central to addressing research and development, safety and
            security, and waste management issues related to nuclear energy (U.S. Government Accountability Office).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Interests:</span> Governments and regulators are interested in providing reliable
            electricity, protecting public safety, maintaining national security, and meeting climate and energy goals.
            They are also concerned with economic factors, such as the cost of nuclear power and the health of the nuclear
            industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Influence:</span> Their influence is very high because they can approve or deny
            licenses for nuclear plants, set safety standards, fund or defund nuclear research, and decide how nuclear
            waste will be managed. Their decisions directly affect companies, communities, and the future of nuclear
            energy.

        <h3>Nuclear Power Companies and Utility Operators</h3>
        <div class="stakeholder-details">
          <p>
            Nuclear power plants are owned and operated by companies and utilities that produce and sell electricity.
            These companies invest in nuclear reactors, safety systems, fuel, and workers. Their main goal is to provide
            reliable power while remaining financially stable. The GAO notes that financial challenges in competitive
            power markets can affect nuclear plants' ability to stay profitable and continue operating (U.S. Government
            Accountability Office).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Interests:</span> These companies are interested in keeping nuclear plants operating
            safely and profitably, extending plant lifespans, and sometimes building new reactors, including advanced
            designs like small modular reactors (SMRs). They are also concerned about regulations that may affect their
            costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Influence:</span> Their influence is high because they control actual facilities and
            jobs. They often lobby governments for supportive policies, subsidies, and favorable market conditions.

        <div class="stakeholder-details">
          <p>
            International organizations, especially the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), play a major role in
            nuclear safety and security. The IAEA promotes a global framework for safe and secure use of nuclear energy by
            developing standards, offering guidance, and helping countries strengthen their safety systems ("Nuclear Safety
            and Security").
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Interests:</span> These organizations are interested in preventing nuclear
            accidents, ensuring that nuclear materials are not used for weapons, protecting people and the environment,
            and supporting peaceful uses of nuclear technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Influence:</span> Their influence is high at the international level. While they do
            not directly operate reactors, their safety standards and recommendations strongly influence national laws and
            policies.

        <div class="stakeholder-details">
          <p>
            Environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and other advocacy groups often take a
            strong position on nuclear energy. Greenpeace, for example, describes nuclear power as "a dangerous waste of
            time" and argues that it is unsafe, expensive, and a distraction from renewable energy ("Nuclear Power: A
            Dangerous Waste of Time").
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Interests:</span> These groups focus on protecting ecosystems, preventing pollution
            and radioactive contamination, promoting renewable energy sources, and addressing climate change in ways they
            see as safe and sustainable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Influence:</span> Their influence is medium. They do not make laws, but they shape
            public opinion, organize campaigns, publish reports, and pressure governments and companies to change their

        <div class="stakeholder-details">
          <p>
            People who live near nuclear power plants are directly affected by how those plants operate. They may benefit
            from local jobs, tax revenue, and investments in the area, but they also face the risks of living close to a
            nuclear facility.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Interests:</span> Local communities are interested in safety, clear emergency plans,

          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Influence:</span> Their influence is medium. Communities can attend public hearings,
            vote in local and national elections, organize community groups, and react strongly to proposed plant
            expansions or closures. Surveys have shown that communities that host nuclear plants often have different

        <h3>The General Public</h3>
        <div class="stakeholder-details">
          <p>
            The general public includes voters and electricity customers who may not live near nuclear plants but are
            still affected by energy policy, electricity prices, and climate change. Public opinion plays a big role in
            whether elected officials support or oppose nuclear energy. A 2025 report from Pew Research Center found that
            about six-in-ten U.S. adults now favor expanding nuclear power plants, and support has increased in both
            political parties since 2020 ("Support for Expanding Nuclear Power Is Up in Both Parties Since 2020").

          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Interests:</span> The public is interested in safety, affordable electricity,
            environmental protection, and trust in institutions to manage risks responsibly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Influence:</span> Their influence is medium to high because public opinion affects
            elections and the political choices that shape energy policy. Bisconti Research also reports that 72% of
            Americans favor nuclear energy to some degree, suggesting that public attitudes may be shifting in a more
            positive direction (Bisconti).

        <h3>Competing Energy Industries (Fossil Fuels and Renewables)</h3>
        <div class="stakeholder-details">
          <p>
            Companies in fossil fuel industries (coal, oil, natural gas) and renewable energy industries (solar, wind,
            hydro) are also stakeholders in the nuclear debate. They compete with nuclear power for market share, policy
            support, and investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Interests:</span> Fossil fuel companies may see nuclear as a competitor that can
            reduce demand for coal or gas. Renewable companies may support or oppose nuclear depending on whether they see
            it as a partner in providing low-carbon power or as a competitor for funding and policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Influence:</span> Their influence is high because these industries have strong
            lobbying power and significant economic resources.

        <div class="stakeholder-details">
          <p>
            Future generations and the environment are stakeholders even though they cannot speak for themselves.
            Decisions about nuclear energy today will affect people and ecosystems far into the future. Nuclear power can
            help reduce carbon emissions and limit climate change, which benefits future generations. At the same time,
            radioactive waste remains dangerous for thousands of years, and nuclear accidents can cause long-term
            environmental damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Interests:</span> Their interests include a stable climate, safe long-term storage
            of waste, healthy ecosystems, and responsible use of technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="small-label">Influence:</span> Their direct influence is low, but they are represented by
            environmental organizations, scientists, policymakers, and international climate agreements.

      <h2>What This Stakeholder Analysis Shows About the Nuclear Energy Debate</h2>
      <p>
        Looking at nuclear energy through the lens of stakeholders shows that the issue is more complicated than just
        being “for” or “against” nuclear power. Governments and regulators must balance safety, energy reliability,
        national security, and climate goals. Nuclear companies focus on plant operation, profit, and long-term
        investments. Environmental organizations worry about accidents, waste, and long-term pollution, while some also
        consider how nuclear fits into climate solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general public, local communities, and workers experience the effects of these decisions in their daily
        lives, through job opportunities, electricity prices, and feelings of safety or risk. International
        organizations like the IAEA help create standards that shape what “safe” nuclear energy looks like across
        countries. Future generations and the environment will live with the long-term consequences of whatever path is
        chosen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This analysis helps prepare for future writing by showing that any discussion about nuclear energy has to take
        multiple perspectives into account. Understanding stakeholders' interests, influence, and concerns makes it
        easier to think critically about possible solutions or compromises in the nuclear energy debate.

        </p>
        <p>
          This article reports on the 2025 National Nuclear Energy Public Opinion Survey done by Bisconti Research.
          It states that 72% of Americans favor nuclear energy, while 28% oppose it, and explains that support has
          become more favorable over the past few decades. The report includes trends over time, descriptions of how
          opinions vary by demographic groups, and discussion about how feeling informed affects support levels. It
          provides charts and clear explanations of the main findings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This source is trustworthy because Bisconti Research has been tracking public opinion on nuclear energy for many years and clearly explains its survey methods. 
          It is helpful for understanding the general public as a stakeholder and how opinions about nuclear power are changing.

        </p>
        <p>
          This webpage from Greenpeace USA explains why the organization opposes nuclear power. It argues that nuclear energy is
          dangerous, expensive, and too slow to help with the climate crisis. The article also claims that nuclear power diverts money
          and attention away from renewable energy sources like wind and solar. It lists problems such as accidents, radioactive waste,
          and hidden costs around decommissioning and insurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Greenpeace is clearly biased against nuclear energy, it is still a very important stakeholder source because it shows
          why some environmental groups strongly oppose nuclear power. This article helps me understand the arguments and concerns of
          anti-nuclear environmental organizations. I can use this source when describing environmental stakeholders and their reasons
          for resisting nuclear expansion.

        </p>
        <p>
          This webpage from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) gives an overview of the international framework for nuclear
          safety and security. It explains how the IAEA works with member states to create safety standards, provide guidance, and help
          countries strengthen their nuclear safety and security systems. The page mentions treaties, conventions, and technical support
          the IAEA offers to protect people and the environment from harmful effects of radiation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This source is reliable because the IAEA is the main international organization responsible for nuclear safety and security.
          It is useful for understanding how international organizations act as stakeholders in the nuclear energy debate. I can use this
          source to support my explanations of how global safety standards influence national regulations and public trust.

        </p>
        <p>
          This article from Pew Research Center summarizes recent survey data about American attitudes toward nuclear power. It reports
          that about six-in-ten U.S. adults now favor expanding nuclear power plants and that support has increased among both Democrats
          and Republicans since 2020. The article compares support for nuclear with support for renewable energy sources and discusses
          how opinions have changed over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pew is a nonpartisan research organization known for its high-quality surveys, so this source is very credible. It helps me
          understand the general public’s views on nuclear energy and how public opinion can affect political decisions. I can use this
          source to back up claims about increasing support for nuclear power and to show that public attitudes are an important part of
          the stakeholder landscape.

        <p>
          This webpage from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) gives an overview of key issues facing the nuclear energy
          sector in the United States. It explains how nuclear power contributes to the nation’s electricity supply and describes the
          roles of federal agencies like DOE and NRC. The page discusses research and development, safety and security, waste
          management, economics, and regulatory challenges. It also notes that both DOE and NRC could better address certain nuclear
          energy issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GAO is a trusted government watchdog agency that provides nonpartisan information to Congress and the public, so this
          source is highly credible. It helps me understand the government and regulators as stakeholders and shows what kinds of
          challenges they face. I can use this source to support explanations of policy, regulation, and economic pressures in the
          nuclear sector.
